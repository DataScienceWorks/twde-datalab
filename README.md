This is the onboarding document for the TWDE Datalab. If you want to get involved, find something confusing, or just want to say hi, [please open an issue](https://github.com/emilyagras/kaggle-favorita/issues).

## Intro
The purpose of this project is to help build a foundational knowledge pool around the fields of data science, machine learning, and intelligence empowerment for ThoughtWorkers in Germany. To do so, we've selected a competition from kaggle.com that, broadly speaking, compares to a realistic problem we could provide for clients. The specific problem is demand forecasting for an Ecuadorian grocery store company. For more specifics, see [the Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting)

# notes for setup
I recommend using anaconda to set up environment using environment.yml

Yet, sometimes necessary latest version is not available. Then please use pip in addition. 
for example,
pip install notebook==5.1.0
